Steps to install rabbitmq and connect from python

1. Rabbitmq install:
    brew install rabbitmq (for mac)
    yum install rabbitmq-server (for centos/RHEL)	
2. Add rabbitmq path to environment variables:
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/opt/rabbitmq/sbin (for mac)	
3. Start server from terminal:
    rabbitmq-server (for mac)
    service rabbitmq-server start (for centos/RHEL)	
4. UI:
    localhost:15672 
5. Install Python libraries for rabbitmq:
    pip3 install pika --upgrade
    
Steps to set up the PostgreSQL DBs

1. pip3 install psycopg2
2. Set up n PostgreSQL servers on different ports. Each server can be used for one cohort site.
    - Initialize a database in a particular directory 
        initdb -D /var/tmp/db1
    - Start the DB instance 
        Eg: pg_ctl -D /var/tmp/db1 -o “-p 5433” start
    - Login to the psql commandline through a particular port and user 
        Eg: psql -p 5433 postgres -U newuser
    - Create a new user and password for the same. Mention the username and password in constants.py
      This is the user and password used to connect to the DB at the coordinator and the cohort. 
        Eg : create user username with password ‘password’;
             grant all privileges on database test to newuser;
    - Create a new database for the new user. This is the database used to store information at the cohort and the coordinator(protocolDB)
        Eg: create database “dbname”



# table for coordinator transaction logs(server running on 5431 port)
CREATE TABLE transaction_log(id varchar(100) primary key, state varchar(100) not null, cohorts varchar);
CREATE TABLE line_number (file_name varchar(100) primary key, number int not null);

# alter the max_prepared_connections variable: 
1) Log into superuser and run : ALTER SYSTEM SET max_prepared_connections TO 100;
2) Restart the database server 

# view currently prepared transactions holding locks 
SELECT gid FROM pg_prepared_xacts WHERE database = current_database()


TEST CASES AND HOW TO EXECUTE THEM :)

Note:
    1. Make sure that database name, username, password are same for all cohorts and coordinator. Provide the 
       database details and ports of coordinator log database and all cohorts in constants.py file
    2. Make sure to run database_state_verifier.py after each test case run
    3. Please refrain from changing other constants in constants.py file for running test cases mentioned below
